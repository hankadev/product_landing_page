## Objective
Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL/).
Fulfill the below user stories. Give it your own personal style.

User stories:
* __User Story #1:__ My product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`.
* __User Story #2:__ I can see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"`. A company logo would make a good image here.
* __User Story #3:__  Within the `#header` element I can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`.
* __User Story #4:__ I can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`.
* __User Story #5:__  When I click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
* __User Story #6:__ I can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.
* __User Story #7:__ My landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`.
* __User Story #8:__ Within the form, there is an `input` field with `id="email"` where I can enter an email address.
* __User Story #9:__ The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
* __User Story #10:__ The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
* __User Story #11:__ Within the form, there is a submit `input` with a corresponding `id="submit"`.
* __User Story #12:__ When I click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully.
* __User Story #13:__ The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
* __User Story #14:__ My product landing page should have at least one media query.
* __User Story #15:__ My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
